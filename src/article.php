                    <p>The picturesque beaches, laidback style of living and fresh food that Greece is so well known for
                        tempts visitors year after year. But if you’re struggling to decide where to begin your Aegean
                        holiday, our travel experts have the first-hand knowledge to point you in the right direction.

                <h3>There’s more to Athens than meets the eye</h3>

                <p>No matter if you’re drawn to the unbelievable black sand beaches of <a href="#">Santorini</a> or the
                    party life
                    of
                    <a href="#">Mykonos</a>, <a href="#">Athens</a>, in all its ancient glory, is the gateway to your
                    idyllic Greek getaway. Marked
                    as
                    one of the oldest cities in the world, Greece’s grungy yet classical capital contains remnants
                    of
                    the 5th century – the rocky hilltops of Acropolis boast the goddess Athena’s Parthenon, and The
                    Temple of Poseidon offers a window into Greek mythology. But there’s more to Athens than these
                    archaeological treats. Movie screens move outdoors in the summer months at Cine Paris Plaka,
                    rooftop
                    bars come alive and there are National Gardens to be explored.
                </p>

                <p>Shane, one of our Europe travel experts, ventured a few kilometres south from here to the <a
                        href="#">Athens
                        Riviera</a> defined by vast stretches of emerald coastline and rocky coves teeming with
                    watersports,
                    esplanades and marinas and inviting blue flag beaches. His stay at the <a href="#">5* Grecotel Cape
                        Sounio</a>
                    was
                    nothing short of luxury – think waterfront dining, poolside cabanas and treatments at the
                    open-air
                    Elixir Spa Retreat. Families are more than well accommodated for with family-friendly suites and
                    villas with private pools, a designated kids’ pool and endless activities at Grecoland.</p>

                <h3>Charismatic Crete</h3>
                <p>

                    Crete is the largest and one of our favourite islands in Greece for its charismatic towns,
                    indescribably clear water and surreal landscapes. Beyond the beach, Shane’s days were spent in
                    the company of the hospitable locals at the opulent Grecotel Amirandes where Picasso originals
                    hang modestly in the restaurants, the open-air amphitheatre is perfect for taking in starry
                    nights and higher end suites come with their own private gym and swimming pool. Exquisite local
                    produce can be found at the hotel’s own Agreco Farm where afternoons are spent sampling the
                    vineyard’s wines and perfectly paired local cheeses, and getting hands-on at the minizoo with
                    younger travellers. And if you’re looking for a vibrant day out, head to Rethymno for
                    postcard-worthy moments and lively waterfront strolls.</p>

                <h3>Magic of Mykonos – the Summer hotspot</h3>
                <p>


                    Charlotte, another of our Europe experts, ventured to the glamorous shores of Mykonos where the
                    white-washed Cycladic buildings with their splashes of blue alongside the infamous nightlife
                    make it an attractive summer hotspot for VIPs and celebrities. The family-owned and run Myconian
                    Collection has some of our favourite hotels on the island. While each emit a very distinct
                    personality, they all make the most of the picturesque Aegean Sea views from ultra-cool swimming
                    pools and furnished private balconies, and serve gourmet cuisine inspired by farm-to-table
                    ingredients. Nestled on the hillside of Elia Bay, the 5* Myconian Villa Collection was no
                    exception, greeting Charlotte with personalised round-the-clock service and impossibly chic
                    interiors and she was continuously impressed by the luxury resort’s ability to capture the
                    essence of lavish living. The opulent villas acting as your own private house in Mykonos, 360
                    degree panoramic views from the saltwater infinity pool and world-class Thalasso spa make it a
                    perfect secluded escape for couples and honeymooners.</p>

                <p>When you manage to pull yourself away from the resort – everything you could possibly need or
                    want for an upscale retreat is at your fingertips – Mykonos flaunts plenty of trendy bars and
                    excellent places to eat just 20 minutes away. Little Venice is one of the island’s more romantic
                    spots to eat and drink. The neighbourhood is lined with charming aged houses right on the
                    water’s edge with the crystal waters lapping precariously close to cobblestoned walkways and
                    dining tables. But if you’re looking for the place to be seen – Mykonos is Greece’s answer to an
                    upscale Ibiza after all – we recommend heading to Scorpios or Nammos Beach. These two exclusive
                    clubs open both day and night sit right on the beachfront offering some of the best places to
                    watch the sunset on the island and can often be seen encircled by the rich and famous’ private
                    yachts.

            <div class="layout-contained layout-contained--medium padding-horizontal">
                <p>And for those looking to learn a little of Greece’s mythological and historical past, Delos
                    Island – one of the country’s most important archaeological sites – is just a ferry ride away.
                    The uninhabited island became a UNESCO World Heritage Site for obvious reasons. Mythology claims
                    it was the birth place of gods Apollo and Artemis and to this day remains a sanctuary to them.
                    Unearthed statues and temples are scattered across the island in their honour and give an
                    insight into ancient life here, the most famous being the Naxos stone lions and columns of the
                    House of Dionysus.</p>
